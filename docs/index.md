## Bay Area water levels & rainfall

*About: The prompt for this project was something I miss from home - and for the first few weeks that I was home for the holidays, I remember simply marveling at the rain. Every time we passed Stevens Creek Reservoir, it felt like the water levels had increased. Driving through the mountains, we could hear the creek's water rushing. So for this project, I decided to take a look at these the creek, the reservoir and the South Bay's rainfall from December 1, 2021 to January 15, 2022*

For starters, it rained over 4 inches in the South Bay over this time period. Most of it was on December 13, when an [atmospheric river](https://www.sfgate.com/weather/article/atmospheric-river-San-Francisco-Bay-Area-2021-16695193.php) brought over 2 inches of rain to the area.

Storms throughout the month and a half also helped fill the Stevens Creek Reservoir. Only 10% of the reservoir's [3,138 acre-feet capacity](https://www.valleywater.org/your-water/local-dams-and-reservoirs) was filled at the beginning of the month. But by January, it was more than 50% full. To be fair, that means it's still about half empty, but it was nice nonetheless to see previously dry areas of the reservoir submerged again.

A creek's [flow rate](https://archive.epa.gov/water/archive/web/html/vms51.html) reflect how much water is moving from the watershed into the creek, with more water meaning faster flow. In the sections of Stevens Creek that ran above Stevens Creek Reservoir and above Highway 85, this meant that the flow rate went from nearly nothing to more than 100 cubic feet per second.

*A methodological note: Precipitation in the National Weather Service data was sometimes indicated as "T," which indicates a barely measurable trace of rain. These values were replaced with zeroes.*
